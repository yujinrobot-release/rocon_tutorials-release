%description
A simple software concert describing how multiple robots launched in simulation
can be used by the concert framework. This package follows the same pattern as
turtle_concert. It is multi typed gazebo robot version of turtle_concert.
Adopted a lot from segbot_gazebo_concert by Piyush Khandelwal

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
